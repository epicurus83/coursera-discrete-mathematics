# Coursera Discrete Mathematics

This is my Github repo for the Introduction to Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science in Coursera, [link](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/discrete-mathematics)

## Languages and Principles

I will be using:
* Python 3 for implementation.
* UnitTest for unit testing.
* PyCharm as my IDE.

I will try to adhere to PEP8 and write the most pythonic code possible. But, if anyone sees something wrong with the way I'm doing things, I would love some feedback!
